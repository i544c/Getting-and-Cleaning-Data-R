**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset** (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

**The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. The goal is to prepare organized data that can be used for further analysis.**

` Step 1: ` Merge the training and testing sets to create a dataset.

` Step 2: ` Extract only the measurements about the mean and standard deviation of each measurement.

` Step 3: ` Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset

` Step 4: ` Appropriately label the dataset with descriptive variable names.

` Step 5: ` From the data set from step 4, create a second independent and organized data set with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.
